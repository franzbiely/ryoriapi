## Paymongo documentation

ÔªøI'll be providing a short summary of our Credit Cards, Direct Online Banking, GCash, and Maya documentation here:
Ôªø
ÔªøIn a Nutshell: Accepting Credit Cards, Direct Online Banking, GCash, and Maya Payments
ÔªøCredit Cards, Direct Online Banking, GCash, and Maya follow the Payment Intent - Payment Method (PIPM) workflow.
Ôªø
Ôªø1. Create A Payment Intent from the server-side
ÔªøWhen a customer initiates a credit card or a PayMaya payment, create a payment intent by calling our Create A Payment Intent API: https://developers.paymongo.com/reference/create-a-paymentintent. Store the Payment Intent ID.
Ôªø
Ôªø2. Create a Payment Method from the client-side
ÔªøCollect Card Information from the client-side with the use of forms. We do not recommend storing this information on your server. Send this information over to us and we'll handle the rest! Create a payment method by calling our Create A Payment Method API: https://developers.paymongo.com/reference#create-a-paymentmethod. Store the Payment Method ID.
Ôªø
Ôªø3. Attach the Payment Intent to the Payment Method
ÔªøConnect the Payment Intent to the Payment Method by calling our Attach To Payment Intent API: https://developers.paymongo.com/reference/attach-to-paymentintent.
Ôªø
Ôªø4. Redirect the Customer for Authentication
ÔªøIn live transactions or 3DS enabled test cards, the response for the Attach To Payment Intent call would include next_action. You would have to redirect the customer to their respective bank/e-wallet for them to authorize the payment.
Ôªø
Ôªø5. Finish
ÔªøOnce this is done, the customer is redirected to your success/failed URL. If you setup your webhooks, we'll also send you a webhook event whether the payment is successful or failed. You can also asynchronously call the Retrieve A Payment Intent API to check the status of the intent. https://developers.paymongo.com/reference/retrieve-a-paymentintent
Ôªø
ÔªøI hope this helps! Just let me know if you have more questions and I'll be right with you! üëç
Your developer partner,
ÔªøSteven
